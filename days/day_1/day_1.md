## LeetCode problem one

### Python crash course to get started. 
This crash course will give you all the concepts needed to solve the problem below. In addition, you will grab all the basic concepts of Python programming to solve the subsequent problem sets. I selected this video because it explains the concepts in a simplified, storytelling format that you can relate to. Secondly, it's just a 35-minute video, so you can finish it in one sitting and gain the most essential Python concepts, not only for beginners but also for intermediate programmers. I will provide a subsequent Jupyter notebook to practice what you learned in the video.

### 1. Two Sum  

Difficulty level: Easy  
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

Given an array of integers¬†`nums`¬†and an integer¬†`target`, return¬†indices of the two numbers such that they add up to¬†target.
You may assume that each input would have¬†**exactly¬†one solution**, and you may not use the¬†same¬†element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.<br>

¬†
> Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].  
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2] <br> 
Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
<br>

Constraints:
* 2 <= `nums.length` <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* -10<sup>9</sup> <= `nums[i]` <= 10<sup>9</sup>
* -10<sup>9</sup> <= `target` <= 10<sup>9</sup>
* Only one valid answer exists.

### Companies asked this question in their job coding interview 
I want to stress that the above question is easy but the big company asks even the most senior software engineer. Here the list of companies and how many times they asked the above problem.  

**Now you become a programmer.** **Congratulation**.  
You started the journey!!
| Time Period | Companies |
|--------------|------------|
| **0 ‚Äì 3 months** | Google (178), Amazon (102), Microsoft (43), Meta (33), Bloomberg (31), Oracle (6), Accenture (4), J.P. Morgan (3), TCS (3), Wipro (3) |
| **0 ‚Äì 6 months** | Infosys (6), IBM (5), Apple (5), Snowflake (5), Capgemini (5), SAP (5), EPAM Systems (4), Zoho (4), Visa (4), Cognizant (4) |
| **6 months ago** | Adobe (73), Yahoo (29), Yandex (27), Uber (25), Goldman Sachs (20), TikTok (13), Tinkoff (9), Walmart Labs (9), Nvidia (9), Deloitte (8) |

### Task #2: Signup on LeetCode website. 
Why? 
- You can see the vast pool of problems
- You can network with most experienced coders and developers with decade of experience
- You can see your progress 
- You can save your progress and show during interview 
- You don't have to download any thing in your desktop/laptop. You can code on the website and run your code. For that reason, you can even solve with your phone. Even no laptop needed

##  Two-Week Python Study Plan [Based on W3School website](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)  
*Goal: Master the fundamentals of Python up to arrays/lists.*

| Day | Topics to Cover | Key Concepts / Practice |
|-----|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Day 1** | Introduction & Setup | Install Python & VS Code <br>Run `hello.py` <br>`print("Hello, World!")` |
| **Day 2** | Python Syntax & Output | Basic syntax, whitespace/indentation <br>Use `print()` and comments |
| **Day 3** | Variables & Naming | Assign variables <br>Understand memory boxes concept <br>Reuse values |
| **Day 4** | Data Types ‚Äì Numbers | `int`, `float` <br>Arithmetic operations: `+ - * / %` |
| **Day 5** | Data Types ‚Äì Strings & Booleans | `str`, `bool` <br>String methods `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.capitalize()` <br>Concatenation vs. numeric addition |
| **Day 6** | User Input & Casting | Use `input()` <br>Convert to `int` / `float` when doing math |
| **Day 7** | Functions | Define functions with `def` <br>Parameters & `return` <br>Call functions vs define them |
| **Day 8** | Control Flow ‚Äì If / Elif / Else | Use conditions to control logic <br>Route based on user input |
| **Day 9** | Loops ‚Äì For & While | `for` loops with `range()` <br>`while` loops for repeating until condition |
| **Day 10** | Collections ‚Äì Lists | Create lists <br>Access items <br>`append()`, `len()`, indexing |
| **Day 11** | Collections ‚Äì Tuples & Sets | Tuple (immutable) <br>Set (unordered, no duplicates) <br>Basic methods |
| **Day 12** | Dictionaries & Nested Structures | Key-value pairs <br>Access/change/add items <br>Nested dicts examples |
| **Day 13** | Combined Practice | Build a mini program using variables, functions, lists or dicts <br>Example: simple expense tracker |
| **Day 14** | Review & Solidify Lists (Arrays) | Revisit lists in detail <br>Practice list comprehensions <br>Apply lists in a problem-solving context |

### How to Use This Plan
- Spend ~30-60 minutes each day: read the corresponding W3Schools section, try the ‚ÄúTry It Yourself‚Äù examples.
- After reading, write a small code snippet applying what you learned.
- On Day 13: build a small project combining topics.
- On Day 14: reinforce by solving/list-related tasks.
