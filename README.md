# Project-100X
This is a repo for the 100-day problem-solving challenge. It has **two parts**: daily **LeetCode problem solving**, which prepares you for any coding interview, and second, **system design** projects. It equips you with all the necessary skills needed to build large scalable systems. You are not learning by watching a tutorial or by reading text, but rather by building a common system. It is a practical-oriented project focused on problem-solving skills. It gives the big picture of system design, which helps you to stand out in any coding interview or helps you to build your own system on your journey in entrepreneurship. The challenge focuses on anyone who wants to develop their problem-solving skills using programming.

## Requirements: 
- Eagerness to learn 
- computer with internet connection (No complicated IDE or other special software needed, all programming online) for those who don’t know IDE (Integrated development environment), just a convenient Microsoft Word software, but for programming with so many features to make the process easy. 
If you don't have computer, you can start coding on your phone on LeetCode website. Nothing should hold you back
- previous programming experience: not needed, but if you have better. You can even learn any programming language you choose as we go along. Those who have a background but need to brush up, we can give a cheatsheet to revise 
- Our primary programming language python (why? easy to learn, convinent, popular with much community, so many path to other specialization  like web development, machine learning, data analysis, DevOps, and more)
  
**Target audience:** beginners with no prior programming experience want to get started, intermediate want to level up their problem solving skill, anyone who wants to improve problem solving skill  
**Goal:** To improve problem solving skill and to design scalable distributed system which can handle millions of users    
## Objectives:
- To solve 100 LeetCode problems and learn the pattern of each problem
- To learn the practical Python programming language  (Learn the basics to the advanced )
- To learn common data structures and algorithms in Python
- To prepare for a coding interview
- To learn the basics of system design concepts 
- To design ten common system designs 
- To collaborate with others on github
## Timeline 1st Batch
*Start:* October 22, 2025    
*End:* January 29, 2026 

## Outcome 
By the end of this challenge 
- You know the basic to advanced concepts of Python programming and are comfortable programming in Python
- You can able to solve the common LeetCode problems, both easy and medium level, and be comfortable solving the hard level 
- You familiar with the common programming problem patterns
- You are prepared to take a coding interview for a job application 
- You can collaborate on decentralised distributed collaboration platforms like GitHub
- You can design a scalable distributed system which serves millions of users at the same time 
## Two parts: Daily LeetCode problem solving and weekly system design 

### 1. LeetCode problem solving 
- Daily, we select one problem and post it in the morning with details 
- End of the day, another post with solutions, patterns, takeaway, related problems, resources 
- Python concepts review  with Jupyter Notebook
### 2. System deign 
- Concepts to read for the week’s system design project 
- We select one real world system design example and start designing 
- Possible design options and resources 
- First two weeks dedicated to familiarising with system design concepts
