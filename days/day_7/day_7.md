You are given an integer array `nums`. The unique elements of an array are the elements that appear exactly once in the array.

Return the sum of all the unique elements of `nums`.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2]
Output: 4

```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no unique elements, and the sum is 0.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 15
Explanation: The unique elements are [1,2,3,4,5], and the sum is 15.
```

Constraints:

1 <= `nums.length` <= 100 <br>
1 <= `nums[i]` <= 100
