## Problem #8 Sum of Unique Elements

Difficulty level: Easy  
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/)

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 ```

Constraints:

1 <= `s.length` <= 2 * 10<sup>5</sup><br>
`s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.
