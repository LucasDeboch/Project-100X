### Problem
### 1. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock 

Difficulty level: Easy  
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

Constraints:

1 <= `prices.length` <= 10<sup>5</sup><br>
0 <= `prices[i]` <= 10<sup>4</sup>
