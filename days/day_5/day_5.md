## Problem #5


Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Substring
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
```

Constraints:

1 <= `s.length` <= 10<sup>4</sup><br>
`s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.  
There will be at least one word in `s`.
