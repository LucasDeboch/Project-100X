# Day #2 LeetCode problem



### 1. Valid Anagram 

Difficulty level: Easy  
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

Output: false
```
 

Constraints:

1 <= `s.length`, `t.length` <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup><br>
`s` and `t `consist of lowercase English letters.
 

**Follow up:** What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
