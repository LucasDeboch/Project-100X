### 1. Reverse Vowels of a String 

Difficulty level: Easy  
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/description/)

Given a string `s`, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "IceCreAm"

Output: "AceCreIm"

Explanation:

The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: "leotcede"
```
 

Constraints:

1 <= `s.length` <= 3 * 10<sup>5</sup><br>
`s` consist of printable ASCII characters.
